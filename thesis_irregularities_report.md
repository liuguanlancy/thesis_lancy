**Thesis Irregularities Report (Updated)**

- Author: Guanlan Liu
- Scope: LaTeX sources under `thesis/` (chapters, tables, figures)
- Goal: Flag actual inconsistencies, warnings, and cleanup opportunities (no edits applied)

**Build Status**

- Compiles successfully; no undefined references or citations in `thesis/main.log`.
- Warnings from `thesis/main.log` (key items):
  - Duplicate destination anchor: 1 occurrence (hyperref) at page.1.
  - Underfull boxes: 4 occurrences.
  - Overfull boxes: 3 occurrences.

Details (from `thesis/main.log` slice 1253–1400):
- Duplicate anchor: “destination with the same identifier (name{page.1}) … duplicate ignored” while entering `chapters/chapter1_introduction.tex`.
- Underfull/Overfull boxes tied to tables:
  - `tables/table_experimental_settings.tex` lines 11, 49, 51, 61 (Underfull); and lines 45–66 (Overfull ~46.7pt).
  - `tables/table_wikitext_lr_comparison.tex` lines 9–32 (Overfull ~4.4pt).
  - `tables/table_financial_qa_lr_comparison.tex` lines 9–32 (Overfull ~10.6pt).

Suggested fixes (optional):
- For duplicate anchor: temporarily disable page anchors for the Roman-numbered front matter, then re-enable for arabic pages, e.g., set `\hypersetup{pageanchor=false}` before `\pagenumbering{Roman}` and `\hypersetup{pageanchor=true}` after switching to `\pagenumbering{arabic}`; or pass `hypertexnames=false` to `hyperref`.
- For Overfull/Underfull table boxes: slightly reduce column content width, insert manual line breaks, or use `p{...}` columns with `\raggedright\arraybackslash` for text; `\small`/`\scriptsize` and `\setlength{\tabcolsep}{...}` can also help.

**Figures, Tables, Assets**

- All `\includegraphics{...}` targets exist; all `\input{tables/...}` files exist.
- One caption missing a label in `thesis/chapters/chapter4_results.tex`:
  - “Best Configurations by Application” table at lines 504–520 has a `\caption[...]` but no `\label{...}`. Add a label (e.g., `\label{tab:best_configs}`) just after the caption.

**Labels and Cross-References**

- No undefined references in the log. General cross-referencing via `\Cref{...}` appears consistent.

**Terminology Consistency**

- “WikiText” vs “Wikitext” casing is inconsistent.
  - Examples: `thesis/tables/table_wikitext_results.tex:21` uses “Wikitext”; `thesis/tables/table_wikitext_results.tex:7` uses “WikiText”. Also appears in `thesis/tables/table_financial_qa_lr_comparison.tex:28`.
  - Action: Standardize to “WikiText” across tables/captions.

**Preamble and Packages**

- `\usepackage{lipsum}` included but no `\lipsum` usage found — safe to remove.
- `\usepackage{epstopdf}` included; no `.eps` assets detected — likely removable.
- `\usepackage{datetime}` present; no explicit `\today`/datetime formatting used — likely removable unless needed for future updates.
- `\usepackage{breqn}` appears unused — consider removing unless used elsewhere.
- `microtype` and `\emergencystretch=2em` are already present (good for box warnings).

**Style/Clarity Checks**

- Abstract phrasing uses “threefold” correctly in `thesis/main.tex:35` (no issue).
- Captions are generally descriptive and consistent; ensure each figure/table has both `\caption` and `\label` (see one missing above).

**Counts and Coverage (sanity)**

- Claimed totals (30 models; 237 evaluations) are consistently stated in Results/Discussion.
- All referenced tables/figures for results exist and compile; dataset names and metrics appear consistent across tables.

**Recommended Next Pass (optional)**

- Add the missing table label in `chapter4_results.tex` (best configs).
- Standardize “WikiText” casing in all tables.
- If desired, drop unused packages: `lipsum`, `epstopdf`, `datetime`, `breqn`.
- If the hyperref duplicate anchor warning is undesirable, apply the page-anchor tweak around front matter.

I can apply these small fixes directly on request (label addition, casing, optional package cleanup, hyperref tweak).
