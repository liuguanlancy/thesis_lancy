      \caption[RMSE and  MPE for Caps with Different Maturities]{Root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean pricing error MPE for caps with different option maturities.
    Panels A and B show the RMSE and the MPE in percentage points  across time for caps implied volatilities
    of all maturities (solid line), for maturities up to three years (dash-dotted line), and for maturities of four to ten years (dashed line). Data are
