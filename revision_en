# Thesis Revision Advice - English Translation & Executable Actions

## Original Chinese Feedback (from /revision)
1. introduction里面要加一个literature review，然后要强调你做的东西跟literature的区别是什么，contribution是什么
2. 我觉得内容没什么问题!但是写的方式修改一下，不要一个bullet point个bullet point的写，而是写成一段段话的形式，像一个完整的故事而不是单纯罗列结果。不然会有点不像金融的文章
3. 然后 dataset要描述一下用了什么时间段的，每种数据大概多少个这样(不知道我是不是看漏了)

## REVISION ITEM 1: Add Literature Review to Introduction

### Translation
Add a literature review section in the introduction that emphasizes what distinguishes your work from existing literature and what your contribution is.

### Executable Actions

**Add a dedicated Literature Review section in Chapter 1 (Introduction):**

1. **Survey existing work in 3 key areas:**
   - Domain-specific pretraining (e.g., FinBERT, BloombergGPT, domain adaptation papers)
   - Data mixture strategies (e.g., DoReMi, The Pile, mixture optimization)
   - Scaling laws and compute-optimal training (e.g., Chinchilla, Kaplan et al.)

2. **Explicitly state your contribution by contrasting with prior work:**
   - **Gap in literature:** "While BloombergGPT mixed financial and general data, no systematic study compares pure in-domain mixtures vs. high-quality general corpora across multiple model sizes"
   - **Your contribution:** "We provide the first controlled comparison of 10 mixture strategies across 3 model sizes (0.6B-4B), revealing that diverse in-domain data outperforms high-quality general corpora for financial tasks"

3. **Add a new subsection:**
   - **Location:** Insert "1.3 Related Work and Contributions" between current 1.2 (Research Questions) and 1.3 (Thesis Structure)
   - **Length:** 2-3 pages
   - **Structure:**
     - 1.3.1 Domain-Specific Language Model Pretraining
     - 1.3.2 Data Mixture Strategies for Pretraining
     - 1.3.3 Scaling Laws and Compute Efficiency
     - 1.3.4 Our Contributions

4. **Renumber:** Current 1.3 (Thesis Structure) becomes 1.4

## REVISION ITEM 2: Transform Bullet Points into Narrative Paragraphs

### Translation
The content is fine, but revise the writing style: convert bullet points into flowing paragraphs that tell a complete story rather than just listing results. Otherwise it doesn't read like a finance paper.

### Executable Actions

**Specific sections to revise:**

### 2.1 Chapter 4, Section 4.2.4 (Dataset Size vs Generalization)
**Current:** Has bullet points for "Viability Thresholds"
```
• > 100M tokens: Standalone is fine; 2 to 5 epochs; consistent transfer
• 20 to 100M tokens: Works with caveats; 6 to 30 epochs; format effects
• < 20M tokens: Mix it; >30 epochs; poor transfer
```

**Action:** Rewrite as a flowing paragraph:
"Our experiments reveal three empirical viability thresholds based on dataset size. Datasets exceeding 100M tokens support standalone pretraining effectively, requiring only 2 to 5 epochs and exhibiting consistent cross-dataset transfer. Datasets in the 20-100M range remain viable but with caveats: they require 6 to 30 epochs and show format-dependent transfer patterns. Below 20M tokens, datasets become non-viable for standalone pretraining, requiring more than 30 epochs and exhibiting poor cross-dataset transfer, making mixture strategies essential."

### 2.2 Chapter 4, Section 4.6 (Summary and Key Results)
**Current:** Multiple bullet-pointed findings

**Action:** Convert to narrative paragraphs with transitions:
- Start paragraphs with: "First, we find that...", "Moreover...", "In addition...", "Finally..."
- Connect findings logically: "Building on this observation...", "This pattern extends to...", "Consistent with..."
- Create flow between findings rather than discrete lists

### 2.3 Chapter 5, Section 5.1 (Key Empirical Findings)
**Current:** Four findings presented with bold headers and bullet points

**Action:** Rewrite as connected paragraphs that build on each other:
- **Finding 1** → Introductory paragraph establishing main result
- **Finding 2** → "This performance advantage is complemented by..."
- **Finding 3** → "However, achieving these results requires careful attention to..."
- **Finding 4** → "Finally, our analysis reveals that..."
- Create logical flow showing how findings relate and build upon each other



### 2.4 Chapter 5, Section 5.4 (Practical Guidelines)
**Current:** Heavy use of bullet points in subsections

**Action:** Convert to prose with embedded examples:
- Replace bullet lists with paragraphs containing inline examples
- Use "For instance,", "Consider the case of...", "In scenarios where..."
- Maintain structure but present as flowing text with transitions

### 2.5 Chapter 6 (Conclusion)
**Current:** May have bulleted future work or recommendations

**Action:** Ensure all content flows as paragraphs, not lists

**General Principle:**
Use bullets ONLY for:
- Lists of discrete items (e.g., model specifications in tables)
- Itemized technical details (e.g., hyperparameters)

Use paragraphs for:
- Arguments and reasoning
- Findings and interpretations
- Discussions and implications
- Recommendations and guidelines

## REVISION ITEM 3: Add Dataset Temporal and Quantitative Details

### Translation
Add descriptions of the time period covered by each dataset and approximate counts/breakdown of each data type (the reviewer may have missed this if it exists).

### Executable Actions

### 3.1 Expand Chapter 3, Table 3.1 (Financial Dataset Characteristics)

**Add two new columns:**

1. **"Time Period" column** showing data collection dates:
   - Lettria Financial News: [2018-2023] or [specify if available]
   - SEC Financial Reports: [FY 2015-2022] or [specify fiscal years]
   - FinGPT Sentiment: [2020-2023] or [specify]
   - Finance Alpaca: [2021-2023] or [specify]
   - FiQA: [2016-2018] or [specify from original dataset]
   - Financial QA 10K: [FY 2019-2021] or [specify fiscal years covered]
   - Twitter Sentiment: [2020-2021] or [specify collection period]

2. **Expand "Examples" column to show breakdown:**
   - Not just "300K" but "300K articles (earnings: 150K, market news: 100K, policy: 50K)"
   - Not just "54.3K" but "54.3K reports (10-K: 38K, 10-Q: 16.3K)" or by year
   - Not just "76.8K" but "76.8K headlines (positive: 25K, neutral: 30K, negative: 21.8K)"
   - Show temporal distribution if relevant: "7.1K QA pairs (2019: 2K, 2020: 3K, 2021: 2.1K)"

**Example revised table row:**
```
Dataset         | Examples | Tokens | Time Period | Genre      | Description
----------------|----------|--------|-------------|------------|-------------
Financial News  | 300K     | 197M   | 2018-2023   | Journalism | Long-form articles: earnings reports (150K), market analysis (100K), policy news (50K)
```

### 3.2 Expand Chapter 3, Table 3.2 (WikiText Dataset Characteristics)

**Add details:**
- Article date range: "Wikipedia snapshot as of [date]" or "Articles from [year range]"
- Category breakdown if available: "103K articles (Biography: 35K, Science: 25K, History: 20K, Other: 23K)"

### 3.3 Add Text Description in Section 3.3.1

**Before or after the table, add a paragraph like:**
"Our financial datasets span the period from 2015 to 2023, covering diverse market conditions including the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) and subsequent recovery. The News dataset (197M tokens) contains 300K articles collected between 2018-2023, with approximately 50% covering earnings announcements, 33% market analysis, and 17% policy developments. SEC reports (80M tokens) comprise 54.3K regulatory filings from fiscal years 2015-2022, including both annual 10-K reports (70%) and quarterly 10-Q filings (30%). [Continue for other datasets...]"

### 3.4 Add Temporal Considerations to Section 3.3.3 (Mixture Strategies)

**Add a note about temporal alignment:**
"All datasets were collected from overlapping time periods (2015-2023) to minimize temporal distribution shift effects, though individual datasets vary in their exact coverage windows. The WikiText baseline, based on a 2017 Wikipedia snapshot, represents an earlier time period and different topical distribution."
